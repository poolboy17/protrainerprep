## How We Make Money

Pro Trainer Prep is an independently operated website that provides fitness certification reviews, career guides, and educational content for aspiring and current personal trainers. We are not owned by, affiliated with, or endorsed by any certification organization.

This site earns revenue through **affiliate marketing**. When you click certain links on our site and make a purchase, we may receive a commission at no additional cost to you. These commissions help us keep the site running and continue producing free, in-depth content.

## What This Means for You

- **You never pay more.** Affiliate links do not increase the price you pay. The cost is the same whether you use our link or go directly to the provider.
- **We recommend what we believe in.** Our reviews and recommendations are based on our own research, analysis, and editorial judgment. We will never recommend a product or service solely because it pays a higher commission.
- **We disclose clearly.** Whenever a link on this site is an affiliate link, we include a note such as "Affiliate link — you pay nothing extra" near the link.

## Our Affiliate Partners

We participate in affiliate programs with various fitness certification providers and education companies, including but not limited to:

- **National Council on Strength & Fitness (NCSF)** — via Impact Radius
- Other certification bodies and fitness education providers as noted in individual articles

## Editorial Independence

Our editorial content is produced independently of our affiliate partnerships. Affiliate relationships do not influence our rankings, ratings, or recommendations. When we say a certification is overpriced, we mean it — even if we earn a commission from that provider.

We use real pricing data, publicly available pass rates, and documented recertification costs to form our opinions. If a product or service does not meet our standards, we will say so regardless of any financial relationship.

## FTC Compliance

This disclosure is provided in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's guidelines on endorsements and testimonials (16 CFR Part 255). We believe in full transparency about how this site generates revenue.

## Questions?

If you have questions about our affiliate relationships or how we make editorial decisions, feel free to reach out. We value the trust our readers place in us and take that responsibility seriously.
