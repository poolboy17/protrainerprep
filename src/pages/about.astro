    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Pro Trainer Prep exists for one reason: to give career changers the honest, numbers-driven
      information they need to choose the right personal trainer certification without overpaying.
    </p>    <p>
      Most "review" sites in the fitness certification space are funded by the companies they review.
      We are not. Our revenue comes from affiliate commissions — clearly disclosed on every page — and
      we review certifications we don't earn commissions from with the same rigor as those we do.
    </p>

    <h2>Editorial Methodology</h2>
    <p>
      Every certification review and cost comparison on this site follows a consistent methodology:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>4-Year Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)</strong> — We calculate the full cost of getting
        and keeping a certification over four years: exam fees, study materials, CPR/AED, continuing
        education, recertification, and liability insurance.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Primary source verification</strong> — Pricing, pass rates, and program details are
        pulled directly from certification body websites, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and NCCA
        accreditation records. We cite every claim.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>NCCA accreditation check</strong> — We verify whether each certification holds
        National Commission for Certifying Agencies accreditation, the standard required by most
        commercial gym chains.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Regular updates</strong> — Pricing and program details change. We re-verify key data
        points quarterly and note the last update date on every article.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Affiliate Transparency</h2>
    <p>
      Pro Trainer Prep earns revenue through affiliate partnerships. When you purchase a certification
      through one of our links, we may receive a commission at no additional cost to you. This is how
      we keep the site free and independent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our affiliate relationships never influence our editorial ratings or recommendations. We
      recommend NCSF as our top pick for most people because the data supports it — not because of
      commission rates. We also review and recommend certifications (like ISSA and ACE) where we have
      no affiliate relationship at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every affiliate link is clearly marked with a disclosure notice. For full details, see our
      <a href="/affiliate-disclosure">Affiliate Disclosure</a> page.
    </p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      The Pro Trainer Prep editorial team includes certified personal trainers, career coaches, and
      data analysts who have collectively evaluated dozens of certification programs. Our writers have
      held certifications from NCSF, NASM, ACE, and ISSA — giving us firsthand experience with the
      programs we review.
    </p>
    <p>
      We write for adults making a real career decision — not college students browsing options. That
      means we focus on practical concerns: cost, employer acceptance, time investment, and
      realistic salary expectations based on Bureau of Labor Statistics data.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Standards</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We never publish a review without verifying pricing directly from the source.</li>
      <li>We disclose every affiliate relationship.</li>
      <li>We update articles when pricing or program details change.</li>
      <li>We include both pros and cons in every certification review.</li>
      <li>We cite the Bureau of Labor Statistics, NCCA, and other authoritative sources for all career and salary data.</li>
    </ul>
