Can you afford to train clients without the right insurance — and what does it actually cost? The short answer: liability insurance runs **$150–$400/year** depending on coverage level and employment model. That's the cost of not losing everything if a client gets injured. Here's what you actually need, what's optional, and how to compare providers.

## What Insurance You Actually Need

**General liability insurance** is non-negotiable if you train independently. It covers bodily injury to clients, property damage, and legal defense costs. The standard policy is **$1 million per occurrence / $3 million aggregate** — that's industry standard and what most gyms and studios require before letting you train on their floor.

**Professional liability (errors & omissions)** covers claims that your professional advice or programming caused harm. If a client alleges your exercise prescription worsened an injury, this is the policy that responds. Many bundled trainer policies include both general and professional liability.

**Product liability** matters if you sell supplements, equipment, or branded products. If you're purely a service provider, you can skip this initially.

**Business property and equipment insurance** protects your gear if you own significant equipment — relevant for independent trainers with a home studio or mobile setup. Optional for trainers working inside an established gym.

**Workers' compensation** is required in most states if you hire employees or subcontractors. As a solo trainer, you typically don't need it — but check your state requirements.

<KeyTakeaway>
For most new trainers, a bundled general + professional liability policy at the $1M/$3M level is the only insurance you need on day one. That runs $150–$300/year. Everything else is situational based on your business model.

## How Your Employment Model Changes Requirements

**Gym employees** are usually covered under the gym's insurance policy. Confirm this with your employer — don't assume. Even as an employee, carrying your own professional liability ($100–$150/year) protects you if the gym's policy has gaps or exclusions.

**Independent contractors at a gym or studio** almost always need their own general liability policy. Most facilities require proof of insurance as a condition of renting floor space or booth time. Budget $200–$400/year.

**Fully independent trainers** (home studio, mobile, outdoor, or online) need the most comprehensive coverage. You're the business, the brand, and the liability. General + professional liability is mandatory, and business property coverage is worth considering if you've invested in equipment.

**Online-only coaches** still need professional liability. If a remote client claims your programming caused injury, you're exposed. The good news: online-only policies tend to be cheaper ($100–$200/year) because there's no physical premises risk.

<ProTip title="Certificate of Insurance (COI)">
Most gyms and studios require a COI — a document from your insurer proving you carry the required coverage and naming the facility as an "additional insured." Make sure your policy allows this (most do) and budget 1–2 business days for your insurer to issue it. Without a COI, many facilities won't let you start training.
</ProTip>

## What Policies Cover and Don't Cover

Standard trainer liability policies typically cover client bodily injury during sessions, slip-and-fall incidents in your training space, allegations of negligent instruction, and legal defense costs regardless of fault.

They typically **don't cover** intentional harm, training outside your certification scope (e.g., providing nutrition prescriptions without credentials), sexual misconduct allegations (these require separate coverage), injuries from equipment you knew was defective, and claims arising from activities not listed in your policy.

Read the exclusions section of any policy carefully. The most common gap for new trainers: training modalities not covered. If you do aquatic training, outdoor boot camps, or combat sports, confirm those activities are explicitly included. Adding them sometimes costs an extra $25–$75/year.

## How to Compare Providers

The major providers serving personal trainers include the NSCA's insurance program, ACE-affiliated coverage, Philadelphia Insurance Companies (PHLY), and specialty providers like Fitness Mentors and NEXT Insurance. Comparison points that matter: annual premium, coverage limits, covered activities list, additional insured options, claims process speed, and whether the policy is occurrence-based or claims-made.

**Occurrence-based** policies cover incidents that happen during the policy period regardless of when the claim is filed. **Claims-made** policies only cover claims filed while the policy is active. Occurrence-based is better protection — pay the small premium difference.

## Insurance in Your 4-Year Total Cost of Ownership

Insurance is a recurring cost that compounds over time. Factor it into your [total cost of ownership](/certifications/cheapest-personal-trainer-certifications) alongside certification, CE, marketing, and equipment.

At $200/year for a standard bundled policy, your 4-year insurance cost is $800. At $400/year for comprehensive independent coverage, it's $1,600. Neither number should scare you — it's the cost of operating a legitimate business. Compare that to the $50,000–$100,000+ a single uninsured lawsuit could cost and the ROI is obvious.

If you're evaluating the full cost of going independent versus staying employed, our [online vs. in-person comparison](/career-building/online-vs-in-person-personal-training) includes insurance as part of the overhead analysis.

Your employment model determines exactly what's required — gym employees may be covered by their employer, but independents and online coaches need their own policies. Factor $200–$400/year into your business plan, get occurrence-based coverage, confirm your training modalities are listed, and get your COI before your first session."
