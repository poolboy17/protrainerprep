Should you work for a gym or go independent? This is the most consequential business decision you'll make as a trainer — it determines your income ceiling, overhead structure, client access, schedule flexibility, and whether you have benefits or buy your own. Neither option is universally better. Here's the honest comparison.

For the full career roadmap: [career building guide](/career-building/career-building-guide).

## The Income Comparison

**Gym employee:** You earn an hourly rate ($15–$30/hour in most markets) or a commission split (typically 40–60% of the session price). If the gym charges $80/session and you keep 50%, you earn $40. On 25 sessions/week for 50 weeks, that's $50,000 gross. The gym handles facility, equipment, marketing, insurance, and client acquisition. Your ceiling is capped by the split.

**Independent:** You set your own rates and keep everything after overhead. At $80/session with 25 sessions/week, you gross $100,000 before expenses. After rent ($500–$2,000/month), [career building guide](/career-building/career-building-guide) ($200–$400/year), marketing ($200–$500/month), and taxes (15–25% self-employment), your net might be $60,000–$75,000. Higher ceiling, but higher costs and risk.

<RealMath title="Same Sessions, Different Outcomes">
**Gym employee:** 25 sessions/week × $40 (50% of $80) × 50 weeks = **$50,000 gross**

**Independent:** 25 sessions/week × $80 × 50 weeks = $100,000 gross − ~$30,000 overhead = **~$70,000 net**

The gap: ~$20,000/year. But the independent trainer works harder on the business side to earn it.
</RealMath>

<KeyTakeaway>
Independent trainers earn 30–40% more net income at the same session volume — but they absorb all business costs, handle their own marketing, and have no guaranteed client flow. The extra income comes with extra work and extra risk.

## What the Gym Gives You

**Built-in client access** is the gym's biggest value. Members are already there, already interested in fitness, and the gym's front desk funnels leads to trainers. You don't need to run ads, build a website, or cold-call prospects. For new trainers without an existing network, this is huge.

**Zero overhead** means no rent, equipment costs, insurance premiums (usually — confirm with your employer), or facility maintenance. Your income from day one is net income minus taxes.

**Structure and mentorship** at better gyms include training protocols, continuing education, and guidance from experienced trainers. If you're brand new, learning the business inside a gym before going independent is a legitimate strategic choice.

**The trade-off:** capped income due to revenue splits, limited control over your schedule and pricing, and potential non-compete clauses that restrict you from taking clients if you leave.

## What Independence Gives You

**Full pricing control** means you set rates based on your value, market, and [niche](/career-building/personal-trainer-niche-specialization) — not a gym's pay scale. Independent trainers in premium niches charge $100–$200/session without splitting revenue.

**Schedule autonomy** lets you design your workday around your life, not a gym's staffing needs. This is especially valuable for [part-time trainers](/career-building/part-time-personal-trainer) and career changers managing a transition.

**Business equity** means you're building something with long-term value — a client list, brand reputation, and referral network that belongs to you. Gym employees who leave start over. Independent trainers take their business with them.

**The trade-off:** you handle everything — [marketing](/career-building/personal-trainer-marketing), client acquisition, scheduling, billing, insurance, taxes, facility access, and equipment. The business work can consume 30–40% of your working hours in Year 1.

## The Hybrid Approach (Best of Both)

Many successful trainers start at a gym and transition to independent once they've built a client base and business skills. This is the lowest-risk path for career changers.

**Phase 1 (months 1–12):** Work as a gym employee or contractor. Learn the business, build a client roster, collect testimonials, and save money. Absorb as much mentorship and client experience as possible.

**Phase 2 (months 12–24):** Start taking independent clients on the side (if your contract allows). Build an [online coaching](/career-building/online-vs-in-person-personal-training) arm. Test your independent pricing and marketing.

**Phase 3 (month 24+):** When your independent income consistently matches or exceeds your gym income, transition fully. You leave with a client base, business systems, and the confidence that comes from tested revenue.

<ProTip title="Check Your Contract">
Before taking independent clients while gym-employed, read your contract carefully. Many gyms include non-compete or non-solicitation clauses that restrict you from training gym members privately — even after you leave. Violating these can result in legal action. If the contract is restrictive, build your independent base from non-gym clients.
</ProTip>

## Who Should Choose Which

**Start at a gym if:** you're brand new with no existing client network, you want to learn the business with lower risk, you value having benefits and guaranteed hours, or you're in a market where gym access dramatically improves client acquisition.

**Go independent if:** you have an existing network or client base, you have business or sales experience from a [previous career](/career-change/career-change-fitness-guide), you've saved 6–12 months of expenses as a financial runway, or you have a [premium niche](/career-building/personal-trainer-niche-specialization) that commands rates the gym can't support.

**Use the hybrid approach if:** you want to minimize risk while maximizing long-term income, you're patient enough for a 12–24 month transition, or you want to test whether independent training works before committing.

<BottomLine
  title="The Bottom Line"
  text="Gym employment gives you built-in clients, zero overhead, and lower risk — at the cost of a 40–60% revenue split and capped income. Independence gives you full pricing control, schedule autonomy, and higher earning potential — at the cost of handling all business operations yourself. The smartest path for most career changers: start at a gym, build skills and clients for 12–24 months, then transition to independent once your revenue is proven. You get the safety net first and the income ceiling second."
