Is ISSA the right certification for your career switch into personal training? ISSA has carved out a niche as the flexible, distance-friendly option — and their bundled deals are aggressively priced. But there's one factor most reviews gloss over: ISSA is **not NCCA-accredited**. That distinction matters more than you think if you plan to work in commercial gyms.

For the full certification overview, see our [certification guide](/certifications/fitness-certification-guide).

## Exam Format and Difficulty

ISSA's CPT exam is **open-book and online** — you take it from home on your own schedule. The exam covers exercise science, program design, nutrition basics, and client assessment. Most candidates find it less stressful than proctored exams from NASM or ACE because you can reference your materials.

The study timeline runs **8–12 weeks** for most people with a fitness background, longer if you're starting from scratch. ISSA provides video lectures, a textbook, and practice quizzes. The pass rate is high — ISSA doesn't publish official numbers, but the open-book format and retake policy (one free retake included) mean most prepared candidates pass.

The trade-off is perception. An open-book, unproctored exam is easier — and employers know that. Some hiring managers view ISSA certification as less rigorous than proctored alternatives.

## Cost and 4-Year Total Cost of Ownership

ISSA's base CPT package runs around **$799** at full price, though they frequently run promotions and bundled deals (2-for-1 certification packages are common). The bundles are genuinely good value if you want multiple credentials.

Here's the realistic 4-year TCO:

ISSA CPT base package at $799, plus CPR/AED at $50, plus continuing education over 4 years at roughly $400 ($100/year), plus recertification fees at approximately $99 every 2 years ($198 total), plus liability insurance at $200/year ($800 total). That puts the **4-year TCO around $2,247**.

Compare that to [NCSF at roughly $1,500–$1,800](/certifications/ncsf-cpt-review), [NASM at roughly $2,500–$3,000](/certifications/nasm-cpt-review), and [ACE at roughly $2,000–$2,500](/certifications/ace-cpt-review). ISSA falls in the middle — cheaper than NASM, pricier than NCSF, competitive with ACE.

## The NCCA Accreditation Gap

This is the most important factor most ISSA reviews don't address clearly. ISSA is accredited by **DEAC** (Distance Education Accrediting Commission), not by the **NCCA** (National Commission for Certifying Agencies). NCSF, NASM, and ACE all hold NCCA accreditation.

Why it matters: many commercial gym chains (LA Fitness, Equinox, Life Time, etc.) require NCCA-accredited certifications for employment. If your plan involves working at a major gym — even temporarily while building an independent practice — ISSA may not get you in the door.

If you plan to work exclusively as an independent trainer, train online, or work at facilities that accept ISSA (many boutique studios and smaller gyms do), the accreditation gap is less relevant. But if you want maximum employer flexibility, an NCCA-accredited cert is the safer choice.

<KeyTakeaway>
ISSA is a legitimate certification with solid educational content. The NCCA accreditation gap is a practical concern, not a quality judgment. Before choosing ISSA, check whether the gyms and studios in your area accept it. If they require NCCA accreditation, ISSA won't work regardless of how good the curriculum is.
</KeyTakeaway>

## Who ISSA Is Best For

ISSA works well for career changers who plan to train independently or online from day one, people who want the flexibility of self-paced distance learning, trainers who value bundled certification deals (ISSA's 2-for-1 promotions add nutrition or strength coaching certs at no extra cost), and anyone already working at a facility that accepts ISSA credentials.

ISSA is a weaker choice for people targeting commercial gym employment at major chains, career changers who want maximum employer flexibility during their transition, and anyone who values the credibility signal of a proctored, NCCA-accredited exam.

## How ISSA Compares to NCSF, NASM, and ACE

Against **NCSF**: NCSF is cheaper, NCCA-accredited, and accepted at more commercial gyms. ISSA offers more flexible study and better bundled deals. For career changers prioritizing cost and employer acceptance, [NCSF wins on value](/certifications/nasm-vs-ncsf).

Against **NASM**: NASM has the strongest brand recognition and is accepted virtually everywhere. It's also the most expensive. ISSA's curriculum covers similar ground at lower cost but without the NCCA accreditation. See our [NASM review](/certifications/nasm-cpt-review) for the full comparison.

Against **ACE**: Both are well-regarded, but ACE holds NCCA accreditation. ACE's curriculum emphasizes behavior change coaching; ISSA's is more traditional exercise science. Price is competitive. Our [NCSF vs ACE comparison](/certifications/ncsf-vs-ace) covers the NCCA-accredited alternatives in detail.

<ProTip title="The Bundle Strategy">
If you're going independent and want multiple credentials, ISSA's bundled deals are hard to beat. Getting CPT + Nutrition certification for the price of one is genuinely good value — just confirm your target employers or clients won't require NCCA accreditation before committing.

<BottomLine
  title="The Bottom Line"
  text="ISSA is a solid certification with flexible study, good bundled deals, and legitimate educational content. The deciding factor is the NCCA accreditation gap. If you're going independent or online and your target market doesn't require NCCA credentials, ISSA is a reasonable choice — especially with their bundle promotions. If you need maximum employer flexibility or plan to work at a major gym chain during your transition, choose an NCCA-accredited alternative like NCSF (best value), ACE, or NASM."
