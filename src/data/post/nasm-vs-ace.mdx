NASM and ACE are the two most commonly compared personal trainer certifications — and for good reason. They're both [NCCA-accredited](/blog/fitness-certification-guide), widely recognized, and available nationwide. But they take meaningfully different approaches to what a personal trainer should know.

Here's how they stack up on the things that actually matter.

## Cost Comparison

<StatHighlight
  stats={[
    { label: "NASM Base Price", value: "$999" },
    { label: "ACE Base Price", value: "$489" },
    { label: "NASM 4-Year Cost", value: "~$1,297" },
    { label: "ACE 4-Year Cost", value: "~$907" }
  ]}
/>

On sticker price, ACE wins by $510. Over four years including recertification, the gap narrows to about $390 — still significant for an entry-level career investment.

<RealMath
  title="4-Year Cost Breakdown"
  steps={[
    "NASM: $699 (sale) + $199 recert × 2 + ~$200 CEUs = ~$1,297",
    "ACE: $489 + $129 recert × 2 + ~$160 CEUs = ~$907",
    "Difference: ~$390 over 4 years"
  ]}
  result="ACE saves you roughly $390 over four years. NCSF saves you even more at ~$699 total."
/>

Both organizations run regular sales. NASM's sale prices typically bring the Self-Study to $699; ACE promotions are less dramatic since their starting price is already lower.

<ProTip
  text="If cost is the deciding factor between NASM and ACE, also consider NCSF — it's NCCA-accredited like both of these, but the 4-year total cost is roughly $699. Read our NCSF CPT review for the full breakdown."
/>

## Curriculum: What You'll Actually Learn

This is where the two certifications diverge most.

**NASM's strength: Program design.** The OPT (Optimum Performance Training) Model (see our full [NASM CPT review](/blog/nasm-cpt-review)) is a five-phase system that gives you a structured framework for designing programs. It tells you exactly what kind of exercises, sets, reps, and tempos to use for each training phase. If you want to walk into a gym on Day 1 and confidently write a program for a new client, NASM prepares you for that.

**ACE's strength: Client coaching.** ACE's curriculum (see our full [ACE CPT review](/blog/ace-cpt-review)) dedicates significant time to behavior change theory, motivational interviewing, stages of change, and communication strategies. If you want to understand *why* clients quit and how to keep them engaged, ACE prepares you for that.

<KeyTakeaway
  text="NASM teaches you how to design great programs. ACE teaches you how to keep clients showing up. Both skills matter — the question is which gap you'd rather fill on your own."
/>

## Exam Comparison

| | NASM CPT | ACE CPT |
|---|---|---|
| **Questions** | 120 scored + 20 unscored | 150 scored |
| **Time** | 2 hours | 3 hours |
| **Passing score** | Scaled 70/100 | 500/800 (~62%) |
| **Pass rate** | ~64% | ~72% |
| **Format** | Computer-based, proctored | Computer-based, proctored |
| **Testing centers** | PSI | Pearson VUE |

ACE's higher pass rate likely reflects better alignment between study materials and exam content — not an easier exam. NASM candidates frequently report that the exam felt harder than their practice tests.

## Employer Recognition

Both certifications are accepted at virtually every gym and fitness facility in the country. The differences are marginal:

**NASM has a slight edge** at large commercial gym chains. Some hiring managers at Equinox, Lifetime Fitness, and similar premium facilities express a preference for NASM-certified trainers. This is a preference, not a requirement — they'll still hire ACE-certified trainers.

**ACE has a slight edge** in health and wellness settings. Corporate wellness programs, hospital-affiliated fitness centers, and community health organizations tend to value ACE's behavior-change focus and nonprofit credibility.

**For independent training**, neither cert matters to clients. Your results, communication skills, and online reviews matter infinitely more than which logo is on your certificate.

## Recertification Requirements

Both require 2.0 CEUs (20 contact hours) every two years.

- **NASM recertification fee**: $199
- **ACE recertification fee**: $129

NASM's CEU ecosystem is larger but also more commercially oriented — expect frequent upsell emails for specializations. ACE offers solid CEU options through their own courses and accepts credits from many approved providers.

<ChooseIf
  optionA={{
    name: "NASM",
    reasons: [
      "You want a detailed program design framework (OPT Model)",
      "Brand recognition matters for your target employer",
      "You plan to work with athletic or performance-oriented clients",
      "You want the largest continuing education ecosystem",
      "You're willing to pay more for the industry's most recognized name"
    ]
  }}
  optionB={{
    name: "ACE",
    reasons: [
      "Client coaching and behavior change resonate with your style",
      "You'll work with general population clients (weight loss, health)",
      "Lower total cost of ownership matters to you",
      "You value the nonprofit, consumer-advocacy angle",
      "You're considering health coaching or corporate wellness long-term"
    ]
  }}
/>

## The Third Option Nobody Mentions

Both NASM and ACE charge more than they need to. The NCSF CPT carries the same NCCA accreditation that makes these two certifications valid — at roughly half the four-year cost.

If you're choosing between NASM and ACE purely on price, the math actually points to a third answer.

<BottomLine
  title="NASM vs ACE: The Bottom Line"
  text="Both are quality certifications that will get you hired. See our [all certification options compared](/blog/fitness-certification-guide). NASM is the better choice if program design and brand recognition are your priorities. ACE is the better choice if client coaching and a lower price point matter more. And if budget is the real deciding factor, NCSF delivers the same NCCA accreditation at roughly $699 over four years."
