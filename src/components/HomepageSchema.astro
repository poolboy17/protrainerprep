  {
    question: 'Do I need a college degree to become a personal trainer?',
    answer: 'No. Most certifications only require a high school diploma and CPR/AED certification. A degree helps but is not required by any major certification body.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much do personal trainers actually make?',
    answer: 'Year 1 averages $25–32K at a commercial gym. Experienced trainers at busy gyms or running independent businesses can reach $60–100K+.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Which certification should I get?',
    answer: 'For most people, NCSF offers the best value — NCCA-accredited (same as NASM), roughly half the price, and accepted at major gym chains. But the right cert depends on your goals, budget, and timeline.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How long does it take to get certified?',
    answer: 'Most people study for 3–6 months while working their current job. Some accelerated programs can get you certified in 4–8 weeks if you study full-time.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is personal training a good career in 2026?',
    answer: 'The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 14% job growth through 2032 — much faster than average. The key is treating it as a business, not just a passion project.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Are you affiliated with any certification company?',
    answer: 'We earn affiliate commissions when you purchase through our links (at no extra cost to you). This is how we keep the site free. We review every certification honestly — including the ones that do not pay us.',
  },
